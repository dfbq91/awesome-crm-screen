## Used dependencies ‚öôÔ∏è

* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Some answered questions ‚ùì
### Ant Design
Like many other React UI libraries, Ant Design has the advantage of having preconfigured components, which saves time in development. I believe that Ant Design is more oriented to business software, such as SaaS, not to mention that there are important companies using it.

### Axios
I chose axios for its browser compatibility, because it is compact and easy to use.

### SAAS
I chose SASS because I have been learning it recently, and what better than to continue learning it by using it in this project.
